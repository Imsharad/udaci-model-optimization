# Development Strategy
This project is divided into four main phases, each represented by a Jupyter notebook. Each notebook builds on the previous one, guiding you through the entire process from baseline analysis to final deployment.

At the end, you will compile your insights and results â€“ which you'd have collected in each notebook â€“ into a final report.

## Baseline Analysis (notebooks/01_baseline.ipynb)

In this first part, you'll establish baseline metrics for the pre-trained model that will serve as your reference point for optimization.

Tasks:

- Run the provided code to load the pre-trained model and test dataset
- Execute the baseline evaluation to measure:
  - Model size (in MB)
  - Inference time (in ms)
  - Accuracy on the test dataset
- Analyze the model architecture to identify potential areas for compression
- Document your findings in the notebook's markdown cells
- Understand the current model architecture and performance
- Review baseline metrics for size, speed, and accuracy
- Identify opportunities for compression

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Consider the trade-offs between size, speed, and accuracy of different compression techniques.

## Compression Technique Exploration (notebooks/02_compression.ipynb)

In this part, you'll implement and evaluate at least two different compression techniques to understand their impact on the model's performance.

Tasks:

- Implement at least two compression techniques from these categories:
  - In-training: pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation
  - Post-training: pruning, quantization, graph fusion
- Evaluate each technique's impact on:
  - Model size
  - Inference speed
  - Accuracy
- Document your findings and begin formalizing ideas for your multi-step pipeline

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Don't just implement techniquesâ€”experiment with different hyperparameters for each to find the optimal configuration.

## Pipeline Development (notebooks/03_pipeline.ipynb)

In this part, you'll design and implement a multi-stage compression pipeline that combines techniques for optimal results.

Tasks:

- Design a pipeline that combines at least two compression techniques
- Implement the pipeline and evaluate its performance
- Ensure the pipeline can meet the technical requirements
- Present performance comparisons with clear metrics
- Document decisions and provide a detailed rationale for your final model selection and trade-offs

ðŸ’¡ Tip: The sequence of applying techniques matters significantly! Some techniques work best as first steps while others are more effective as finishing touches.

## Mobile Deployment (notebooks/04_deployment.ipynb)

In this final notebook, you'll package your optimized model for mobile deployment and verify its performance.

Tasks:

- Convert your optimized model to a mobile-ready format
- Run on a mobile/emulator and capture measurements to confirm requirements are met
- Verify the model behaves well in context and any mobile-specific optimizations

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Mobile deployment often reveals unexpected challenges. Consider the end-user experience when evaluating your final model.

## Final Report (report.md)

Compile your journey and findings into a professional report using the provided template.

Report Components:

- Executive summary tailored for C-level review
- Detailed methodology and technical approach
- Comparative analysis of compression techniques
- Performance metrics and visualization for your final optimized model
