# UdaciSense Model Optimization - Session Progress

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Optimize a pre-trained MobileNetV3 computer vision model for mobile deployment while meeting CTO requirements:
- Reduce model size by **70%** (per official project summary)
- Cut inference time by **60%**
- Maintain accuracy within **5%** of baseline

## Current Status: Initial Setup & Planning

This document tracks the progress of the model optimization project. The initial project structure is in place, but the core implementation and experimentation tasks are yet to be completed. The main focus is to get the notebooks running and then proceed with the optimization tasks.

## Outstanding Items (Based on `problems.md`)

### PRIORITY 1: Fix Notebook Execution
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Objective**: Resolve all errors in the Jupyter notebooks to enable a clean run from start to finish.
- **Tasks**:
  1.  **Fix Dependency Installation**: Correct the `pip install` commands in `01_baseline.ipynb` and `02_compression.ipynb` to ensure all required libraries are installed.
  2.  **Resolve `ModuleNotFoundError`**: Specifically address the `matplotlib` import error in `01_baseline.ipynb`.
  3.  **Execute All Notebooks**: Run all cells in all four notebooks to generate the necessary outputs and metrics.

### PRIORITY 2: Complete Code Implementation
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Objective**: Fill in the missing code sections in the notebooks.
- **Tasks**:
  1.  **Complete Configuration Dictionaries**: In `02_compression.ipynb`, provide the configurations for the in-training compression techniques (quantization, pruning, distillation) and graph optimization.
  2.  **Implement Pipeline Logic**: In `03_pipeline.ipynb`, complete the `OptimizationPipeline.run` method to correctly apply the optimization steps.

### PRIORITY 3: Perform Experiments and Analysis
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Objective**: Run the compression experiments and analyze the results.
- **Tasks**:
  1.  **Establish Baseline**: Run `01_baseline.ipynb` to get the baseline performance metrics.
  2.  **Run Compression Experiments**: Execute `02_compression.ipynb` to evaluate at least two compression techniques.
  3.  **Implement and Evaluate Pipeline**: Run `03_pipeline.ipynb` to test the multi-stage optimization pipeline.
  4.  **Deploy and Verify**: Run `04_deployment.ipynb` to create and verify the mobile-ready model.

### PRIORITY 4: Final Reporting
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Objective**: Update the `report.md` with the actual results from the experiments.
- **Tasks**:
  1.  Populate the report with the metrics and analysis from the executed notebooks.
  2.  Write the executive summary based on the final results.
