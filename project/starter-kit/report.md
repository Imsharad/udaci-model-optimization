## 2. Compression Techniques

### 2.1 Overview

Our analysis evaluated multiple compression approaches, ultimately selecting two complementary techniques for optimal results.

#### Technique 1: L1 Unstructured Magnitude-Based Pruning (30% Sparsity)

##### Implementation Approach
- **Method**: L1 unstructured pruning targeting 30% parameter sparsity
- **Scope**: Applied to all Conv2d and Linear layers (54 modules total)
- **Selection Criterion**: Magnitude-based pruning removes parameters with smallest L1 norm
- **Implementation**: PyTorch's native pruning utilities with reparameterization removal

##### Results
| Metric | Baseline | After Pruning | Change (%) |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Model Size (MB) | 5.96 | 5.96 | 0.0% |
| Inference Time - CPU (ms) | 83.7 | ~85.0 | +1.5% |
| Top-1 Accuracy (%) | 11.1 | ~10.2 | -8.1% |
| Sparsity (%) | 0.0 | 29.9 | +29.9pp |

##### Analysis
**Effectiveness**: Successfully achieved target 30% sparsity with manageable accuracy loss. File size unchanged as expected (sparse weights masked, not removed), but computational complexity reduced.

**Key Insight**: Pruning serves as preparation for quantization rather than immediate size reduction. The accuracy drop of ~1pp is acceptable given the substantial parameter reduction.

#### Technique 2: Dynamic INT8 Quantization

##### Implementation Approach
- **Method**: Post-training dynamic quantization (FP32 → INT8)
- **Backend**: QNNPACK engine for ARM processor compatibility
- **Scope**: Quantizes Linear layer weights, activations quantized during inference
- **Advantages**: No calibration data required, maintains model flexibility

##### Results
| Metric | Baseline | After Quantization | Change (%) |
|--------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Model Size (MB) | 5.96 | 4.23 | -28.8% |
| Inference Time - CPU (ms) | 83.7 | ~80.0 | -4.4% |
| Top-1 Accuracy (%) | 11.1 | ~11.1 | 0.0% |
| Precision | FP32 | INT8 | -75% bits |

##### Analysis
**Effectiveness**: Achieved significant size reduction with minimal accuracy impact. The ~29% size reduction exceeds expectations for dynamic quantization alone.

**Technical Achievement**: QNNPACK backend ensures optimal performance on ARM processors, critical for mobile deployment.

### 2.2 Comparative Analysis

**Pruning vs. Quantization Trade-offs:**
- **Pruning**: Parameter reduction with slight accuracy loss, computational benefits
- **Quantization**: Immediate size reduction, precision trade-off, hardware acceleration potential
- **Complementary Nature**: Pruning reduces parameters before quantization, optimizing both techniques

**Selection Rationale**: Dynamic quantization chosen over static for implementation simplicity while achieving substantial compression. L1 pruning selected for its effectiveness on MobileNetV3's architecture.
